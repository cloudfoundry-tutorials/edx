# Cloud Foundry on edX

This content is freely available on edX.

## Audience

The goal of this content is to answer the questions "what is it?" and "why do I care?". The Linux Foundation e-learning course intends to cover the question "how do I use it?". 

While aimed at a technical audience, this content can also serve non-technical audiences. 


## Engagement

The edX platform is heavily trafficked by a broad audience. The existing content in edX would see 10s of thousands of unique enrollments per year. 

Metrics are available to content owners at https://insights.edx.org.

## Exercises

Because this content is focused on the "why" of Cloud Foundry, it should limit hands on exercises of features and functions. The "how do I use it?" should existing in the Linux Foundation e-learning and at https://tutorials.cloudfoundry.org.

That being said, it may be useful to include some hands on examples to illustrate capabilities of the platform. Whenever possible, the preference is to link to existing exercises in https://tutorials.cloudfoundry.org (or on Katacoda). Remember the audience is varied and plan accordingly. Content outside of edX is ideal for deep technical dives.


## Course Information for LF

The following information is provided to the Linux Foundation education team for inclusion in the course catalog.

### Course Description 

_Short description (1 concise paragraph/phrase; 25-50 words; max 255 characters including spaces; functions as a tagline)_

Deploying and managing applications securely and efficiently is critical in today's technology organizations. As a result, organizations are turning to Kubernetes to run their workloads, only to find massive complexity associated with the platform. Cloud Foundry is the modern model to deliver cloud-native applications to any infrastructure, including Kubernetes. 

_Long description (2-3 paragraphs addressing the following: short course summary, why is the topic important in todayâ€™s context, how will learners benefit from this course, how it will enhance their career; 150-300 words recommended; max 2500 characters including spaces)_

This course answers the questions _"what is Cloud Foundry?"_ and _"why should I use it?"_. The course begins with a high-level introduction to Cloud Foundry, highlighting the main capabilities and concerns of the platform. We then discuss the relationship between Cloud Foundry and Kubernetes before providing an immersive, hands-on experience that anyone can complete. Next, we will look at the features and capabilities of the Cloud Foundry platform, highlighting the impact from three perspectives: developers, operations, and security with compliance teams. 

The Linux Foundation e-learning course titled [Cloud Foundry for Developers](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/training/cloud-foundry-for-developers/) answers the question _"how do I use it?"_. 

### Course Learning Outcomes

_By the end of this course, you should be able to:_

- Understand the major capabilities of the Cloud Foundry platform and the value it brings to custom software development teams
- Understand the security and compliance implications of using a developer focused platform like Cloud Foundry
- Articulate the difference between Cloud Foundry and infrastructure platforms like Kubernetes
- Understand the open source model that governs the Cloud Foundry project

### Course Audience

While aimed at a technical audience, this course is widely applicable, including to non-technical audiences. It is not necessary to be a developer or operator to complete this course. The hands-on portion does not require any special skills, software installs, or environments. It, like this course, is designed for a broad range of skills and backgrounds. 

### Knowledge/Skills Prerequisites

_Please be as specific as possible, e.g. if students should be familiar with Kubernetes, please list the most important Kubernetes-related concepts they should know about_

There are no prerequisites. 
  
### Exercises/System Prerequisites

There are no prerequisites or system requirements beyond a web browser.

### What the Course Prepares For

_Short description (3-5 sentences discussing what the course prepares students for, including any related certifications or specific job roles)_

This course prepares you to make informed decisions regarding developer platform selection and use in custom software organizations. We help you understand the needs of custom software organizations from the standpoint of developers, operators, and security and compliance teams. In addition, this course highlights the challenges of developing and operating custom software applications throughout the lifecycle and offers a perspective on what this process could look like for teams that select the right platform.

### Outline

_Chapter titles and learning objectives for each chapter_


1. Introduction to Cloud Foundry: In this section, we delve into Cloud Foundry's role in technology organizations. First, we cover Cloud Foundry at a high level, the guiding principles, and the core concerns the platform aims to address. We then discuss the relationship between Cloud Foundry and Kubernetes, highlighting how Cloud Foundry can unlock the complexity of Kubernetes before getting hands-on with the platform.

2. Developer Concerns: In this section, we look at the capabilities of Cloud Foundry from the perspective of a typical developer. We look at application lifecycle management, supported workloads, application containerization, team constructs, networking and routing, services, and visibility and awareness. 

3. About the project: In this section, we discuss the structure and engagement model of the open-source project. We cover the open-source model and ecosystem, contributors and member companies, and discuss engaging with the project and community.
