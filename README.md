# Cloud Foundry on edX

This content is freely available on edX.

## Audience

The goal of this content is to answer the questions "what is it?" and "why do I care?". The Linux Foundation e-learning course intends to cover the question "how do I use it?". 

While aimed at a technical audience, this content can also serve non-technical audiences. 


## Engagement

The edX platform is heavily trafficked by a broad audience. The existing content in edX would see 10s of thousands of unique enrollments per year. 

Metrics are available to content owners at https://insights.edx.org.

## Exercises

Because this content is focused on the "why" of Cloud Foundry, it should limit hands on exercises of features and functions. The "how do I use it?" should existing in the Linux Foundation e-learning and at https://tutorials.cloudfoundry.org.

That being said, it may be useful to include some hands on examples to illustrate capabilities of the platform. Whenever possible, the preference is to link to existing exercises in https://tutorials.cloudfoundry.org (or on Katacoda). Remember the audience is varied and plan accordingly. Content outside of edX is ideal for deep technical dives.
