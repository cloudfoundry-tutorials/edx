In this section, we delve into Cloud Foundry's role in technology organizations. First, we cover what Cloud Foundry is, the guiding principles, and the core concerns the platform aims to address. We then discuss the relationship between Cloud Foundry and Kubernetes, highlighting how Cloud Foundry can unlock the complexity of Kubernetes before getting hands-on with the platform.

## Chapters

- [What is Cloud Foundry?](/intro-to-cf/what-is-cf): Cloud Foundry is an application platform designed to bring efficiency, security, and speed to technology organizations. The core principles of the platform manifest themselves in _"the Cloud Foundry way"_. 

- [Cloud Foundry & Kubernetes](/intro-to-cf/cf-and-k8s): Cloud Foundry and Kubernetes differ in focus, goals, and complexity. Cloud Foundry on (or with) Kubernetes is the best of both worlds.

- [Try It](/intro-to-cf/try): One of the easiest ways to understand the value of Cloud Foundry is to see it in action. This immersive, browser-based scenario does not require any software installs, coding, or special skills. Anyone can do it!
