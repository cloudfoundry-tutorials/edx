Cloud Foundry is an application platform designed to bring efficiency, security, compliance, and speed to technology organizations. Cloud Foundry makes it faster and easier to securely build, test, deploy, and scale applications. It provides a choice of the underlying infrastructure (including Kubernetes), developer frameworks, and application services. In addition, operational aspects of the platform are standardized and automated, freeing operators to focus on higher-value tasks while still provider developers with a secure, compliant self-service experience.

Cloud Foundry is an open-source project, guided by its contributors, governed by a foundation, funded by its members, and community-driven. The project is backed by Google, IBM, Microsoft, VMware, SAP, SUSE, and [more](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/members/).

## The Cloud Foundry Way

_The Cloud Foundry Way_ focuses on cross-team efficiency through well-established cloud-native opinions and extremely high levels of automation. For understanding, it is helpful to ask the question: _"why does your software development organization exist?"_

Typically, custom development shops build and operate apps that drive business. Success necessitates moving quickly, in a lean fashion, on a tight budget while maintaining a good security posture and presence.  So how can this be achieved?

* **Allow developers to focus on business outcomes.** Applications power business. The more developers can focus on building great apps, the more they can contribute to the business. With Cloud Foundry, developers are free from the burden of defining and maintaining containers, provisioning and managing services, and complex configurations of infrastructure elements.

* **Standardize and automate frequent interactions and best practices.** Cloud Foundry allows operators to test, configure, and secure platform capabilities in a single location for all users before being released to developers. This approach frees operators to manage the platform proactively. Answering questions like "what versions of Ruby or MySQL are currently in production" are easy to answer with Cloud Foundry.  

* **Make security and compliance an accelerator.** In many IT shops, security and compliance are seen as impediments to getting to production. Because Cloud Foundry focuses on self-service and standardization, security and compliance are core to the platform. Operators and security teams dictate the available self-service capabilities, ensuring no overbearing approval processes or ticketing systems are needed. All applications are configured and run using the same standardized capabilities.

You may have heard the mantra "make doing the right thing the easy thing." **Cloud Foundry makes doing the fast, outcome-focused, secure, compliant, proven, right thing the easy thing**. As a result, Cloud Foundry enables entire organizations to be more productive, have more fun to work at, and substantially impact the bottom line. This is _the Cloud Foundry Way_.

## First Class Principles

Cloud Foundry allows organizations to focus on the applications, not the platform. It removes the cost and complexity associated with configuring, managing, and securing infrastructure for applications.

For the large group of custom applications in technology organizations, Cloud Foundry yields significant capabilities. 

* **Any infrastructure**. By decoupling applications from infrastructure, organizations can make individual decisions about where to host workloads: on-premise, in public clouds, in managed infrastructures, on virtual machines, or in Kubernetes. Moreover, these workloads can be moved as necessary in minutes, with no changes to the applications.

* **Interoperability & Integration**. Cloud Foundry is highly adaptable and will continue to evolve with shifts in technology. Therefore, it is easy to adopt new tools, languages, or platforms down the road. Cloud Foundry enhances current workflows. It is compatible with the tech and tools in use today, including Kubernetes and Docker. 
 
* **Open Source**. Cloud Foundry is an open-source project with an open contribution and governance model. This model maximizes flexibility to avoid vendor lock-in. The Cloud Foundry Foundation helps to oversee a trustworthy community of diverse minds who have come together to tackle all kinds of challenges. More perspectives and divergent thinking yield more robust solutions.

* **Access to services** Self-service, on-demand provisioning of services enables developers to expediently access the tools they need. The industry-standard [Open Service Broker API](https://www.openservicebrokerapi.org/) makes this possible.

Combined, the capabilities of Cloud Foundry yield the best possible outcomes for the complex mission of IT organizations.

## Impact

As we continue through the course, we will highlight the impact of using Cloud Foundry on developers, operators, and security and compliance teams. Many of the concerns are cross-cutting, but for simplicity, we will attempt to characterize impacts most relevant for each group. 

These are broad groups of people so let's define our goals for each:

- **Developers**: We define developer concerns as those pertaining to the building, evolving, maintaining, and running of applications. We realize not all developer teams are responsible for all maintenance of running of applications, and that is perfectly OK. We are more concerned with the need for the actions rather than who is actually doing the work. Cloud Foundry capabilities allow developers to focus on code, not infrastructure.

- **Operations**: Deploying and maintaining large-scale platforms can be challenging. Large platforms are complex and consist of many different components and sub-systems. Cloud Foundry makes it easier for operators to manage large-scale platforms through a solid separation of concerns, highly automated processes, and a strict focus on the entire lifecycle of each component. With Cloud Foundry, operators can be more efficient, more declarative, and more proactive in managing the platform.

- **Security & Compliance**: Security and compliance teams are responsible for ensuring applications, processes, and platforms adhere to organizational standards and remain secure. In many organizations, security and compliance teams are seen as impediments. The high levels of automation and orchestration built into Cloud Foundry can alleviate the bottlenecks in traditional organizations. Standardization allows for good test coverage and removes one-off solutions, reducing attack vectors. Securing a small set of standard features or components is more straightforward than securing _any_ component in a bring your own infrastructure solution. 

If the above roles do not line up precisely with your organization, do not fret. We are more concerned with the major responsibilities rather than who actually completes the work. We simply use the above throughout the course to quantify Cloud Foundry's impact on the work associated with these roles.
