Cloud Foundry is an application platform designed to bring efficiency, security, and speed to technology organizations. Cloud Foundry makes it faster and easier to securely build, test, deploy, and scale applications, providing a choice of the underlying infrastructure (including Kubernetes), developer frameworks, and application services. In addition, operational aspects of the platform are standardized and automated, freeing operators to focus on higher-value tasks while still provider developers with a secure, compliant self-service experience.

Cloud Foundry is an open-source project, guided by its contributors, governed by a foundation, funded by its members, and community-driven. The project is backed by Google, IBM, Microsoft, VMware, SAP, SUSE, and [more](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/members/).

## The Cloud Foundry Way

_The Cloud Foundry Way_ focuses on cross-team efficiency through well-established cloud-native opinions and extremely high levels of automation. For understanding, it is helpful to ask the question: _"why does your software development organization exist?"_

Custom development shops build apps that drive business. Success necessitates moving quickly, in a lean fashion, on a tight budget while maintaining a good security posture and presence.  So how can this be achieved?

* **Allow developers to focus on business outcomes.** Applications power business. The more developers can focus on building great apps, the more they can contribute to the business. With Cloud Foundry, developers are free from the burden of defining and maintaining containers, provisioning and managing services, and complex configurations of infrastructure elements.

* **Standardize and automate frequent interactions and best practices.** Cloud Foundry allows operators to test, configure, and secure platform capabilities in a single location for all users before being released to developers. This approach frees operators to manage the platform proactively. Answering questions like "what versions of Ruby or MySQL are currently in production" are easy to answer with Cloud Foundry.

* **Make security and compliance an accelerator.** In many IT shops, security and compliance are seen as impediments to getting to production. Because Cloud Foundry focuses on self-service and standardization, security and compliance are core to the platform. Operators and security teams dictate the available self-service capabilities. No overbearing approval processes or ticketing systems are needed. 

You may have heard the mantra "make doing the right thing, the easy thing." **Cloud Foundry makes doing the fast, outcome-focused, secure, compliant, proven, right thing the easy thing**. As a result, Cloud Foundry enables entire organizations to be more productive, have more fun to work at, and substantially impact the bottom line. This is _the Cloud Foundry Way_.

## Principles

Cloud Foundry allows organizations to focus on the applications, not the platform. It removes the cost and complexity associated with configuring, managing, and securing infrastructure for applications.

For the large group of custom applications in technology organizations, Cloud Foundry yields significant capabilities. 

* **Any infrastructure**. By decoupling applications from infrastructure, organizations can make individual decisions about where to host workloads: on-premise, in public clouds, in managed infrastructures, on virtual machines, or in Kubernetes. Moreover, these workloads can be moved as necessary in minutes, with no changes to the app.

* **Interoperability**. Cloud Foundry is highly adaptable and will continue to evolve with shifts in technology. Therefore, it is easy to adopt new tools, languages, or platforms down the road.  
 
* **Open Source**. Cloud Foundry is an open-source project with an open contribution and open governance model that gives users maximum flexibility to avoid vendor lock-in. We help to oversee a trustworthy community of diverse minds who have come together to tackle all kinds of challenges. More perspectives and divergent thinking yield more robust solutions.

* **Integration**. Cloud Foundry enhances current workflows. It is compatible with the tech and tools in use today, whether AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, Java, .NET, or most other technologies.

* **Access to services** Self-service, on-demand provisioning of services enables developers to access the tools they need expediently. The industry-standard [Open Service Broker API](https://www.openservicebrokerapi.org/) makes this possible.

Combined, the capabilities of Cloud Foundry yield the best possible experience for IT organizations.
