One of the easiest ways to understand the value of Cloud Foundry is to see it in action. This immersive, browser-based scenario does not require any software installs, coding, or special skills. Anyone can do it!

In the tutorial, you will:

- Deploy an application to Cloud Foundry
- Provision a database and make it available to your app
- Scale the application
- Observe some of the resiliency of Cloud Foundry by killing an app instance
