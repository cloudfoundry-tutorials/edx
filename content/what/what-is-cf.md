Cloud Foundry is an application platform designed to bring efficiency, security, and speed to custom development organizations. Cloud Foundry makes it faster and easier to build, test, deploy, and scale applications, providing a choice of the underlying infrastructure (including Kubernetes), developer frameworks, and application services. In addition, operational aspects of the platform are standardized and automated, freeing operators to focus on higher-value tasks while still provider developers with a secure, compliant self-service experience.

Cloud Foundry is an open-source project, guided by its contributors, governed by a foundation, funded by its members, and driven by a community. The project is backed by Google, IBM, Microsoft, VMware, SAP, SUSE, and [more](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/members/).

## The Cloud Foundry Way

_The Cloud Foundry Way_ focuses on cross-team efficiency through well-established cloud-native opinions and extremely high levels of automation. To understand what this really means, it is helpful to ask the question: _"why does your software development organization exist?"_

If you have a custom development shop, it is likely to build apps that drive your business.  In order to be successful, you need to move quickly, in a lean fashion, on a tight budget, while maintaining good security posture and presence.  So what do you need to achieve this?

* **Allow developers to focus on business outcomes.** The functionality of your applications run your business. The more developers can focus on building great apps, the more they can contribute to your business. With Cloud Foundry, developers are free from the burden of defining and maintaining containers, provisioning and managing services, and complex configurations of infrastructure elements.

* **Standardize and automate common interactions and best practices.** Cloud Foundry allows operators to test, configure, and secure platform capabilities in a single location for all users. This work is completed before being released to developers, freeing operators to manage the platform proactively. Answering questions like "what versions of Ruby or MySQL are currently in production" are easy to answer with Cloud Foundry.

* **Make security and compliance an accelerator.** In many IT shops, security and compliance are seen as impediments to getting to production. Because Cloud Foundry focuses on self-service and standardization, security and compliance are core to the platform. Self-service capabilities available to developers are and approved by operators and security teams. No overbearing approval processes or ticketing systems are needed. 

You may have heard the mantra "make doing the right thing, the easy thing." **Cloud Foundry makes doing the fast, outcome-focused, secure, compliant, proven, right thing the easy thing**. As a result, Cloud Foundry enables entire organizations to be more productive, have more fun to work at, and have a more substantial impact on your bottom line. This is _the Cloud Foundry Way_.
