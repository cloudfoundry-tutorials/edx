In this section, we discuss the structure and engagement model of the open source project.

- [The Open Source Model](/project/open-source): Cloud Foundry is a large and diverse ecosystem. The open-core model is used to ensure compatibility and consistency across different Cloud Foundry distributions.

- [Contributors and Members](/project/contributors-and-members.md): Cloud Foundry is built by a wide array of companies collaborating to make Cloud Foundry the best platform for developers. Over 40 companies have significantly contributed to Cloud Foundry projects and you can too. Membership makes it possible for the Foundation to remain an agnostic voice in a competitive cloud market.

- [Engaging](/project/engaging.md): You don't have to be a contributor or member to be part of the community (though you certainly can be!).  The Cloud Foundry community is a vibrant, worldwide group driven by collaboration, inclusivity, compassion, transparency, and curiosity. We hold a collective vision for an ethical, people-first technology community, and future.
