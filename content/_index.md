# The Modern Application Platform

Deploying and managing applications securely and efficiently is critical in today's technology organizations. As a result, organizations are turning to Kubernetes to run their workloads, only to find massive complexity associated with the platform. Cloud Foundry is the modern model to deliver cloud-native applications to any infrastructure, including Kubernetes. 

## Overview

This course answers the questions _"what is Cloud Foundry?"_ and _"why should I use it?"_. The course begins with a high-level introduction to Cloud Foundry, highlighting the main capabilities and concerns of the platform. We then discuss the relationship between Cloud Foundry and Kubernetes before providing an immersive, hands-on experience that anyone can complete. Next, we will look at the features and capabilities of the Cloud Foundry platform, highlighting the impact from three perspectives: developers, operations, and security with compliance teams. 

The Linux Foundation e-learning course titled [Cloud Foundry for Developers](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/training/cloud-foundry-for-developers/) answers the question _"how do I use it?"_. 

## Intended Audience

While aimed at a technical audience, this course is widely applicable, including to non-technical audiences. It is not necessary to be a developer or operator to complete this course. The hands-on portion does not require any special skills, software installs, or environments. It, like this course, is designed for a broad range of skills and backgrounds. There are no prerequisites beyond a web browser. 

So, welcome! Let's jump right in and start with an [introduction to Cloud Foundry](/intro-to-cf/)!
